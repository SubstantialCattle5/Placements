**Denormalization** is the process of intentionally introducing redundancy into a normalized database to improve query performance. While normalization ensures minimal redundancy and data integrity, denormalization optimizes for speed and efficiency, especially for read-heavy applications.

### **Why Introduce Redundancy?**

Denormalization is useful for:
1. **Optimizing Query Performance**: Pre-computed redundant data allows the database to respond faster, especially for complex queries.
2. **Minimizing On-the-Fly Computations**: Storing pre-calculated or redundant values reduces the need for recalculations during every query, resulting in quicker responses.

### **Denormalization Techniques**

There are several key techniques to effectively denormalize a database:

#### **1. Table Splitting**
- **Purpose**: Break a large table into smaller, more manageable tables.
- **Benefit**: Optimizes query performance by focusing on specific tables rather than processing large datasets.

#### **2. Adding Derived and Redundant Columns**
- **Purpose**: Add columns with pre-calculated or redundant data (e.g., totals, averages).
- **Benefit**: Reduces the need for recalculating values in every query, speeding up complex queries.

#### **3. Mirrored Tables**
- **Purpose**: Create duplicates of frequently accessed tables.
- **Benefit**: Allows faster query execution by reducing the load on the original table, especially in high-traffic databases.

### **Normalization vs. Denormalization**

| **Aspect**               | **Normalization**                                         | **Denormalization**                                      |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Goal**                  | Removes redundancy and ensures data consistency.          | Introduces redundancy to improve query performance.       |
| **When to Use**           | Ideal for update-heavy databases with minimal joins.      | Best for read-heavy databases with frequent costly joins. |
| **Example**               | Dividing data into multiple related tables (e.g., `Customer`, `Orders`). | Combining related data into a single table for faster access. |

### **How to Denormalize a Database**

Here are the common methods used to denormalize databases for faster query execution:

#### **1. Introducing a Redundant Column (Pre-Joining Tables)**
- **Description**: Add columns containing data that would normally be obtained through a join.
- **Example**: Instead of joining `Customer` and `Orders` tables for each query, store `Customer_Name` directly in the `Orders` table.

#### **2. Table Splitting**
- **Description**: Split a large table into smaller, more manageable ones based on frequently queried data.
- **Example**: Separate `User_Profile` and `Transaction_History` into two tables, making queries for each more efficient.

#### **3. Adding Derived Columns**
- **Description**: Add columns for pre-computed values like totals or averages.
- **Example**: Include a `Total_Order_Amount` column in the `Orders` table to avoid recalculating the sum each time.

#### **4. Using Mirrored Tables**
- **Description**: Create duplicate tables optimized for different query patterns or applications.
- **Example**: One table for reading product details and another for writing new products, each optimized for specific operations.

#### **5. Materialized Views**
- **Description**: Store the result of complex queries in a physical table to avoid recalculating each time.
- **Example**: A materialized view for monthly sales reports that pre-computes the data for efficient querying.

### **When to Use Denormalization**

Denormalization should be applied with caution due to its potential to increase data redundancy. It is especially useful when:

- **Costly joins** are frequent, and performance is being impacted.
- The **database is read-heavy**, meaning there are more SELECT queries than INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE.
- Data updates are infrequent, reducing the complexity of maintaining consistency across redundant fields.
