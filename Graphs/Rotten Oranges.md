## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` `grid` where each cell can have one of three values:

- `0` representing an empty cell,
- `1` representing a fresh orange, or
- `2` representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is **4-directionally adjacent** to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return _the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange_. If _this is impossible, return_ `-1`.

## Example

**Input:** grid = `[[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]`
**Output:** 4

## Constraints

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10`
- `grid[i][j]` is `0`, `1`, or `2`.
