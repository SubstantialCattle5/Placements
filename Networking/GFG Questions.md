# Basic Questions 

1. Name two technologies by which you would connect two offices in remote locations. - 
	1. [[VPN]] - Extends a private network across multiple networks which are either not trusted or with a different owner.
	3. [[Cloud Computing]] - Performing computations and storage in a remote server over a network. 

2. What is inter-networking? 
	1. Is the practice of connecting multiple distinct computer networks together to create a larger, unified network. 
	2. This is done using devices like **routers**, **gateways**, and **switches** that can transmit data across network boundaries, enabling communication between different types of networks, such as local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and the internet.
	3. The ***goal of inter-networking is to allow systems from various networks to exchange data and resources seamlessly, regardless of their underlying hardware, protocols, or configurations.*** The internet is the most prominent example of inter-networking, as it connects millions of networks worldwide.

3. [[OSI model]]

5. Define [[HTTPS]] protocol? - 
	1. **Hypertext transfer protocol secure.** 
	2. Advanced version of the [HTTP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/http-full-form/)protocol. 
	4. Its port number is 443 by default. 
	5. Uses [SSL/TLS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-ssl-tls-handshake/) protocol for providing security.

6. Name some services provided by the application layer in the Internet model? #osi
	1. Mail services
	2. Directory services
	3. File transfer
	4. Access management
	5. Network virtual terminal

7. What is a zone-based firewall?
	1. An advanced method of stateful firewall. 
	2. A stateful database is maintained in which the 
		1. Source IP address
		2. Destination IP address 
		3. Source port number 
		4. Destination port number are recorded. 
	3. Only the replies are allowed. 
	4. If the traffic is Generated from inside the network then only the replies (of inside network traffic) coming from outside the network are allowed.

7. What is a server farm? 
	1. It provides the combined computing power of multiple servers housed within the same facility interconnected together by simultaneously executing one or more applications or services. 
	3. A server farm is also known as a **server cluster** or **computer ranch**.
	
8. [[CIA triad]]

10. What is Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption?
	1. **Symmetric Encryption** : encryption and decryption is handled by the same key, making it less secure.
	2. **Asymmetric Encryption :** Uses the philosophy of public and private key encryption techniques. More secure but slower than Symmetric. 
	
11. [[IPSEC]]

13. Define Digital Signal? 
	1. digital signature is a mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software, or digital document.

14. The difference between IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and a firewall? 
15. What is the meaning of threat, vulnerability, and risk?
	1. **Threats** are anything that can exploit a vulnerability accidentally or intentionally and destroy or damage an ****asset****.
	2. **Vulnerability** means a gap or weakness in our protection efforts.
	3. **Risk** is nothing but an intersection of assets, threats, and vulnerability.
