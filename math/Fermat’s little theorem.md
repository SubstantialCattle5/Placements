$$
a^p = a (mod p)
$$
p is prime 
and for any integer a, the number $a^p -a$ is an integer multiple of p. 

if a is not divisible 
$$a^p-1 ≡ 1 (mod p)$$


Example 
Find the remainder when you divide $3^{100,000}$ by 53.

Since 53 is a prime number we can apply this theorem,  

$3^{53}=1mod53$

**Dividing**, 100000 by 52 to come as close as possible 

quotient = 1923 and remainder = 4 

raising it to 1923  and then to 4 
answer would be 
$3^4mod53$



We can also use [[Fermat’s little theorem]] to find the inverse of a number, 

$a^{m-1}=1 (mod m)$

if we multiply both sides by $a^{-1}$

$a^{-1}=a^{m-2}(modm)$
