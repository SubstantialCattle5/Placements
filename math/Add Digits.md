## Problem Statement

Given an integerÂ `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

## Example

**Input:** num = 38
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
## Constraints

$0 <= num <= 2^31 - 1$

## Approach
### 1. Brute Force
- **Description:** Run a recursive operation on add digits and keep on adding the last digit and removing it from the number.Till it reaches the length of one where we check if the response if greater than 10 or not if yes then we again check through it.
- **Time Complexity:** $O(log(n))$
- **Space Complexity:** 

### 2. Optimized
- **Description:** Explain the optimized approach.
- **Time Complexity:** 
- **Space Complexity:**
